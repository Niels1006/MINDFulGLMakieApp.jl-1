# Graphical User Interface for [MINDFulMakie.jl](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFulMakie.jl)

This project aims to interactively visualize [MINDFulMakie.jl](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/MINDFulMakie.jl) graphs while being lightweight, trivial and flexible to use. 

It is still in a very early state, so there is much more to come. This only shows a small set of current features.


## Features

- Visualize graphs from [simplenotebook](https://unistuttgart-ikr.github.io/MINDFulNotebookExamples.jl/simplenotebookexample.html).
- Add any compatible .graphml topologies, they get detected automatically!
- Choose between different IBNs, they get dynamically updated when switching topologies.
- You can zoom, stretch and move all graphs. Or even make it fullscreen.


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
-$ Julia -i src/Main.jl
```
